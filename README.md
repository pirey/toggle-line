# toggle-line.vim

Hide vim statusline and tabline (and tmux statusline, if running inside tmux), because sometimes, they're just get in our way.

Or, we can display them again, because sometimes we love being distracted.

## Usage

Press `<Space>ts` to toggle statusline.

See `:h toggle-line`.

## Installation

Install using any vim plugin manager, or with vim-plug:

    Plug 'pirey/toggle-line.vim'

Then run `:PlugInstall`
